What went well,
- I thought that the team work worked well in that we split off into different groups being backend and front end that way we was able to distinguish between tasks for everyone. It worked better in pairs of 3â€™s as then we could spot mistakes or typos if any where made much quicker.

- Our progress in general for the first day has been good as we managed to exceed our goals in the amount of features that were completed.

What we could improve on,
- Possibly having a GitHub pull and push strategy to reduce the amount of merge conflicts that occur as merge conflicts can waste time as a group trying to sort them out.
